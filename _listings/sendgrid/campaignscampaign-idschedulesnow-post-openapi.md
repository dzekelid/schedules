  title: SendGrid Add Campaigns Campaign  Schedules Now

    **This endpoint allows you to immediately send a campaign at the time you make the API call.**

    Normally a POST would have a request body, but since this endpoint is telling us to send a resource that is already created, a request body is not needed.
